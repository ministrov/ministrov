<h1 align="center">Greetings, Esteemed Colleagues! 👋, I'm Anton Zhilin</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Frontend developer from Russia, Moskow</h3>

I am involved in frontend development for commercial projects within the React ecosystem, using TypeScript, Next.js, ReduxToolkit, Zustand. I read a lot of literature on the intersection of business and software development. I'm also a frequent visitor to LeetCode and Codewars, and enjoy reading about architecture, design patterns, and system design.

I'm an explorer of new tech, an avid learner, and a problem-solver at heart. When I'm not in code, you'll find me watching tech-related YouTube videos, fueling my curiosity.

Feel free to connect with me @antonzhilin83 for all things tech or just to say hello! Let's shape the future of tech together. 🌟
